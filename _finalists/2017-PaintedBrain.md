We have a Multi-Purpose Data-Driven WordPress theme called Mantis, created by our staff, volunteers, interns, and participants from CodiePie Coding Workshop (Painted Brain's tech department). Mantis serves as a tool to teach and create advanced functioning websites with the topÂ tier modules that bring interactivity to the next level; giving users' a great experience.
