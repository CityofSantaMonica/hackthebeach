    <h2><i class="fi fi-bulb"></i> Why</h2>
    <p>This is an unprecedented time for civic engagement. Governments are opening their data and internal processes, creating new avenues for collaborative problem solving.</p>
    <p>From startups to well-established firms, Silicon Beach is booming. A rich talent pool coupled with a city government at the forefront of civic tech puts us in a unique position for innovative success.</p>
    <p>The City of Santa Monica is proud to continue our tradition of partnership building. We invite you to join our civic tech community as we work together to make a positive impact on our city.</p>
